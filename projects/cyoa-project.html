            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <p>A skill I improved on during this project was collaboration. I was able to communicate with my teammate and use both of our ideas to code this project.
</p>
            <p> If there was something that we disagreed on we discussed and came up with something that we both like. Another thing that I worked on was the Growth Mindset.
       If there was something that I got stuck on, I just tried my best to figure out a solution and did not give up until it was fixed. This mindset is crucial when working
       on something. If you do not have a growth mindset you won't get anywhere when creating something. <br> When creating this webpage, I used my knowledge of css and html to create cool effects over my elements. I used the :hover command and the transition property commands to
       create these effects. Something that I have taken away from this project is communication. If I did not communicate with my partner we would not have finished. Over the weekend, we worked
       on this project. There were only very minor things that were challenging. For example, getting the logos of the animals to look good. But mainly this project was not very hard. Overall, the project was very fun to make and I enjoyed it.
